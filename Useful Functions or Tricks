heapq to form priority queue or min heap.
heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, element)
element can be a turple, e.g. (count, e).
When use heapq.heappop, it will only consider the 1st element in the turple, i.e. count in the above example
heapq.heappop(heap) -> pop the 1st element


dictionary.items() -> get turple
Example:
{"a": 1, "b": "2"}.items = [("a", 1), ("b", 2)]

You can specify the key of sorted([("a", 1), ("b", 2)], key=lambda x: x[1])
Refer Top K Frequent Elements - sort.py

You can sort it in descending order by using sorted(array, reverse=True)
